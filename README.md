Contains some MATLAB code used for Point Clouds
File named density is used to measure number of points per 1cm for an optimal strip of points chosen from the point cloud in both x and y direction
File named best_fit_plane calculates the best fit plane x,y,z coordinate points (code i found on the MatLab Q/A Forum
File named bestfitplane also calculates best fit plane given x,y,x coordinates ( My code)
